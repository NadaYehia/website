abstract: Significance How does variability between neurons affect neural circuit
  function? How might neurons behave similarly despite having different underlying
  features? We addressed these questions in neurons called Kenyon cells, which store
  olfactory memories in flies. Kenyon cells differ among themselves in key features
  that affect how active they are, and in a model of the fly’s memory circuit, adding
  this interneuronal variability made the model fly worse at learning the values of
  multiple odors. However, memory performance was rescued if compensation between
  the variable underlying features allowed Kenyon cells to be equally active on average,
  and we found the hypothesized compensatory variability in real Kenyon cells’ anatomy.
  This work reveals the existence and computational benefits of compensatory variability
  in neural networks. ,  Neural circuits use homeostatic compensation to achieve consistent
  behavior despite variability in underlying intrinsic and network parameters. However,
  it remains unclear how compensation regulates variability across a population of
  the same type of neurons within an individual and what computational benefits might
  result from such compensation. We address these questions in the Drosophila mushroom
  body, the fly’s olfactory memory center. In a computational model, we show that
  under sparse coding conditions, memory performance is degraded when the mushroom
  body’s principal neurons, Kenyon cells (KCs), vary realistically in key parameters
  governing their excitability. However, memory performance is rescued while maintaining
  realistic variability if parameters compensate for each other to equalize KC average
  activity. Such compensation can be achieved through both activity-dependent and
  activity-independent mechanisms. Finally, we show that correlations predicted by
  our model’s compensatory mechanisms appear in the Drosophila hemibrain connectome.
  These findings reveal compensatory variability in the mushroom body and describe
  its computational benefits for associative memory.
